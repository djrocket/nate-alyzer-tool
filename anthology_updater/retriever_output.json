{"transcript_text":"I want to talk about MCPs today. They're\r\nobviously incredibly impactful. We're\r\nall using them. But at the same time, I\r\nnoticed that when the MIT study came\r\nout, when other studies have come out\r\nthat talk about the failures that\r\nenterprises experience when they use AI,\r\nmuch of the time those failures come\r\ndown to how you integrate AI into other\r\nworkflows, other operations of the\r\nbusiness. And guess what? The king of\r\nintegrations right now is MCP. I would\r\nargue that getting your MCP architecture\r\ncorrect is a huge predictor of whether\r\nor not you can implement an AI program\r\nsuccessfully. And I want to give you\r\ntoday seven different failure modes with\r\nMCP architectures that I have seen\r\norganizations fall into. And I want you\r\nto avoid those. And so we're going to go\r\nthrough all seven of them and we're\r\ngoing to talk about why they don't work\r\nand what you should do instead. The\r\nfirst is an assumption. the universal\r\nAPI router death trap. So, if you've\r\never worked in integrations before, you\r\nshould be familiar with what I call and\r\nwhat others call the NXM integration\r\nproblem. It's basically whenever you get\r\ninto integrations, you get this\r\ncombinatorial problem where the number\r\nof integrations scales much faster than\r\nthe raw count of tools. So for example,\r\nif you have three tools and five\r\nendpoints, you're going to have much\r\nmore than just three integrations or\r\nfive integrations. It's n * n. You're\r\ngoing to have like 15. And so MCP\r\nprovides a way out of that. And people\r\nthink that that's enough, right? They\r\nthink because model context protocol\r\nprovides sort of a universal API. It's\r\ndescribed as a universal API. It's\r\ndescribed as like this USB port you plug\r\nstuff into. You can just use anything\r\nfor it, right? You can stick it\r\neverywhere. It will solve your NXM\r\nintegration problem space. It will take\r\nthat combinatorial scaling issue away\r\nwhere if you've ever managed these tools\r\nand you have to build integrations, you\r\nknow, you can never catch up. There's\r\nalways more tools. There's always more\r\nendpoints than there's time. And people\r\nare starting to believe that MCP solves\r\nfor this magically. It does not solve\r\nfor it magically. Part of why is because\r\nit adds latency. You cannot just route\r\nyour API calls through MCP as I've seen\r\nsome people want to do and try to do\r\nbecause it will kill the performance of\r\nwhatever you're building. It adds\r\nsomewhere between 300 and 800\r\nmilliseconds of latency on each call\r\nplus the cost on top of that of\r\ninference. MCP like the correct framing\r\nfor MCP is not as a transaction layer or\r\nanything in the real time operations\r\npathway. It's not a universal fix for\r\nthe end times integration problem. I\r\nwish there was a universal fix. There\r\nisn't. Instead, think of MCP as an\r\nintelligence layer for specific complex\r\nworkflows. Failure number two, the idea\r\nthat context is the same thing as data.\r\nMCP provides data retrieval and so\r\npeople assume that they can use it for\r\ndatabase queries. That's incorrect. It's\r\nit's more accurate to say that MCP\r\nprovides contextual orchestration across\r\nmultiple systems and that matters\r\nbecause it enables MCP to orchestrate\r\ninsights about the data in the\r\nbackground process. But you should not\r\nassume that is the same as a SQL query\r\nto get data back. This has cost\r\nimplications, right? Studies have shown\r\nanywhere and that it boggles my mind\r\nthat this is an actual study. ARX\r\npublished this anywhere between a 3.2 25\r\nand a 20 increase in input tokens with\r\nMCP integrations. I don't care what\r\nnumber it is at that point. The the\r\nreason that you pay attention is because\r\nMCPs dramatically increase the context\r\navailable to inference by a factor of up\r\nto 100 or more. It is a massive\r\nadditional piece of context. And what\r\nMCP is supposed to do if you're using it\r\nright is to help you orchestrate which\r\ncontext you're calling for a particular\r\ntask. It is not supposed to sit there\r\nand just be your universal data\r\nretrieval layer. That is a waste of\r\nmoney and you actually won't get better\r\nresults than you would just get using\r\nSQL. So that's failure number two.\r\nFailure number three, the hot path\r\nplacement disaster. I have seen\r\ndevelopers who want MCP to be on their\r\ncritical path. Like as in when a\r\ncustomer makes a query on a\r\ntransactional site, we put MCP there so\r\nthat we know how to infer and answer\r\ntheir question as intelligently as\r\npossible. That sounds great on a\r\nwhiteboard. It is an absolute\r\nperformance disaster. It is horrific.\r\nJust think about it. Let's say you have\r\n5,000 operations a second and your your\r\nAPI\r\nis is capable of handling millions.\r\nThat's not a problem. If you have 5,000\r\noperations a second, you're maxing out\r\nthe MCP. Your your API would be fine,\r\nbut your MCP is is throttling and dying.\r\nYour MCP is in trouble because it wasn't\r\ndesigned to handle production traffic.\r\nAnother example, let's say you're\r\ngetting one meg of MCP output tokens at\r\na bucker request. That's charged on\r\nevery single follow-up message.\r\nSuddenly, you're spending thousands of\r\ndollars an hour on MCP. Are you sure you\r\nwant to do that? That's if it stands up,\r\nright? That's if it doesn't fall over.\r\nThat's if the latency doesn't make the\r\ncustomer leave. You need to separate\r\nyour fast path, direct APIs, from a\r\nsmart path, MCP orchestration. And you\r\nneed to know when to use each of those.\r\nFailure number four, security theater\r\ninstead of real security. It is it is\r\noften the case. This is not just for\r\nMCP. It's for AI projects in general.\r\nSecurity controls get added after the\r\narchitecture is defined as if security\r\nis a gate at the end. It's not. It's not\r\na gate at the end. You have to think\r\nabout it from the beginning. As an\r\nexample, you could have an architecture\r\nthat allows you to forward raw user\r\ncredentials that would break audit\r\ntrails and create vectors for breaches.\r\nThat is something that would happen\r\ninherently in a particular MCP\r\nconfiguration and you wouldn't be able\r\nto add a gate at the end to really\r\naddress it. This is not just a\r\ntheoretical risk. Donna exposed a\r\nthousand customers data to each other\r\nfor 34 days through an MCP\r\nmisconfiguration. It wasn't just exposed\r\nto the wider internet. It was it was\r\nlike other customers could read each\r\nother's data. You need to think about\r\nsecurity first when architecting MCP and\r\nreally when architecting AI to begin\r\nwith. Architectural decisions need to\r\nunderstand that you have different\r\nbreach factors and security vectors to\r\npay attention to with AI because\r\nlanguage itself becomes a security risk.\r\nThat's one of the challenges that we\r\nhave right now just in designing secure\r\nAI smart browsers. People much smarter\r\nthan me, people like Simon Willis have\r\ncalled out that they are not sure how we\r\ndesign a good smart browser because a\r\nsmart browser by its nature is\r\nvulnerable to language and there's a lot\r\nof language on the internet and how on\r\nearth can you secure that? How do you\r\nactually help the LLM distinguish\r\nbetween the context it ingests which may\r\ncontain dangerous instructions and the\r\nspecific prompt that you as a user give\r\nit? It is one of the most vexing\r\nproblems in security right now. That\r\ndoesn't mean you shouldn't implement\r\nMCPs in production systems. None of what\r\nI'm saying says don't do it. Instead,\r\ntreat security as a first class object\r\nand make sure that you are designing\r\nsystems that are secure by default\r\nversus systems that are gated for\r\nsecurity at the end. And if you want,\r\nyou know, a whole video on secure\r\npatterns for MCP, we can talk about\r\nthat. It's out of scope for this video,\r\nbut it's a critical issue that I think\r\ncompanies need to start by prioritizing.\r\nRight? If you aren't doing it yet, start\r\nby having the conversation. Start by\r\nasking yourself, how could an actor\r\nmisuse the path that we've diagrammed in\r\nthe architecture? That will get you\r\nfarther than like 90% of companies on\r\nsecurity right now. Failure number five,\r\nthe assumption of magical performance.\r\nMost people assume I have AI, I use MCP,\r\nI add external data, I'm going to get\r\nbetter performance. It's just going to\r\nbe magical. Again, we go back to ARC\r\npapers. MCP integrations can cause a\r\ndecline in tasks. In fact, the measured\r\ndecline was 9 and a half% on average.\r\nAnd you ask yourself why. Oh, and by the\r\nway, 9 12% covers knowledge tasks 1.4%\r\ndrop. Reasoning tasks a 10.2% accuracy\r\ndecline. And code generation a 17% flat\r\nperformance drop. This is all from the\r\npaper help or hurdle rethinking model\r\ncontext protocol augmented large\r\nlanguage models which came out on the\r\n18th of August by weang ha nan jang and\r\na few other authors. Fundamentally\r\nexternal information introduces noise\r\nthat can interfere with internal\r\nreasoning. That is why performance can\r\ndrop. In other words, if you think about\r\nMCP as a contextual orchestration layer,\r\nyou have to recognize that the context\r\nyou give it can cloud its judgment\r\nrather than improving it. If your\r\ncontext is not clean, if your context is\r\ndirty, if the external data you add is\r\nclouding the issue, you are going to get\r\nperformance drops. That doesn't mean\r\neverybody gets performance drops. When I\r\nlook at this, what I say is, okay,\r\nprobably most of these people were using\r\nMCP for the wrong ask and put bad\r\ncontext in and look what they got.\r\nBecause anecdotally, people are also\r\nusing MCP to and see tremendous\r\nperformance gains. They complete tasks\r\nfaster. Their chat experience has tools\r\nenabled. I benefit from MCPs and so do\r\nyou when you use Claude and Claude calls\r\ntools. And so it's not that MCPs\r\ninherently are a problem. It's that you\r\nassume that using MCPs magically makes\r\nthings better and magically adding\r\ncontext doesn't make things better if\r\nthe context is dirty. You have to it\r\ncomes back to data quality. You have to\r\nthink about the data quality rather than\r\nmaking magical performance assumptions.\r\nFailure number six, the idea that the\r\nanswer is microservices everywhere. I\r\nhave seen architectures where developers\r\nwill tell me look every microser will\r\nget its own MCP server for flexibility.\r\nIt's going to be really beautiful. It\r\nlooks great on the whiteboard. The\r\nproblem is that it's really hard to\r\nmaintain all those servers. One\r\ncompromised MCP server can expose the\r\nentire service mesh. The network\r\noverhead is really high because each MCP\r\ncall adds network hops and\r\nauthentication overhead. It it doesn't\r\nhave to be have to be that way. You\r\ndon't have to configure your\r\nmicroservices that way. You can have MCP\r\nwork within microservices, not as\r\nmicroservices. You can have a federated\r\nsecurity gateway with centralized policy\r\nenforcement. So you're not having to\r\nenforce security on every microser\r\nseparate. And so this might seem\r\nabstrous like if you haven't worked in\r\nmicroser architectures, you may be kind\r\nof rolling your eyes right now. But the\r\nthing to take away is that MCPs again\r\nare not a substitute for APIs. MCPs are\r\nnot really built to be the front gate of\r\nmicroservices. And you should, if you're\r\nusing a microser architecture, treat\r\nyour microser architecture as core. Make\r\nsure you have federated security so that\r\nyou're not dealing with it at the\r\nindividual microser layer, which a lot\r\nof good architectures already have. And\r\nthen where you need MCP, stick it within\r\na particular microser for inference.\r\nProblem number seven, the idea that MCP\r\ngives you real-time everything. I think\r\nthis stems from the idea that chat bots\r\nneeded real time information and MCPs\r\nenabled Claude to browse the web. And so\r\nthere's this developer fantasy that\r\nadding MCP will get you real-time\r\npricing or inventory or payment\r\nprocessing or whatever. Don't use it\r\nthat way. I've already talked about the\r\nlatency issue. Please, please, please\r\nthink about a binary protocol that would\r\nbe faster and more secure. Think about\r\nthe idea that you can use an ordinary\r\nreal-time check from an API and you can\r\nget so much more in a secure manner\r\nbecause MCPs are also not easily\r\ndebuggable. If you are on a pathway like\r\npayment processing and you need to be\r\nable to audit it, you don't want to be\r\nin a position where MCP made an\r\ninference and you have to just guess why\r\nthe payment was denied. That doesn't\r\nprovide auditability. You need to make\r\nsure\r\nthat if it's safety critical, if it\r\nneeds to be auditable, if it has to be\r\nreal time, that you are not using MCP.\r\nMCP is fine for analysis and insights.\r\nIt's fine for an intelligence layer,\r\nwhich is what I've been talking about.\r\ndo not put it in the pathway of a direct\r\nprotocol for an operational system.\r\nThat's just not the way it works. Well,\r\nall right. So, we've gone through seven\r\ndifferent issues with MCP. We've talked\r\nabout the real-time everything delusion,\r\nmicroservices everywhere as a trap, the\r\nidea of magical performance as an\r\nassumption, security theater, hot path\r\nplacement, context equaling data\r\nconfusion, and finally, the idea of a\r\nuniversal API router. All of those are\r\nmisconceptions. How do we start to think\r\nabout MCP more correctly? MCP excels\r\nbackground analysis and reporting. It\r\nexcels at cross-system workflow\r\norchestration. It excels at content\r\ngeneration. It excels at summarizing\r\ncontent. It actually excels at complex\r\nmulti-step processes where two to three\r\nseconds of latency is fine. But MCP is\r\nnot for product catalog lookups. MCP is\r\nnot for payment processing. MCP is not\r\nfor real time pricing or real-time\r\nanything. MCP is not for a critical path\r\nthat requires sub 200 millisecond\r\nresponse times. It just won't get there.\r\nMCP is not for safety critical control\r\nsystems. So if you want to implement MCP\r\nsuccessfully and in turn hit the\r\nleverage point that enables you to\r\nimplement AI successfully because so\r\nmuch of this is around integration of\r\ndata and how you understand data and\r\nLLM. Make sure that you understand that\r\nMCP is for the intelligence layer. Let\r\nMCP orchestrate insights for you. Let it\r\nuse the inference you pay for to get you\r\nintelligence. Have a separate\r\ntransaction layer with direct APIs that\r\nhandle operations. Design controls for\r\nsecurity before you start to design the\r\narchitecture. And make sure you know\r\nyour constraints, your boundaries, and\r\nyour threat vectors. And know your\r\nlatency requirements, your performance\r\nexpectations before choosing a pathway,\r\nbefore choosing an architecture. The\r\nbottom line is that if, as the MIT\r\nheadline says, 95% of AI projects fail\r\ndue to integration bottlenecks, getting\r\nMCP architectural placement right may\r\nwell be the difference for you between\r\njoining that failure rate and getting in\r\nthe 5% that succeed. MCP is becoming\r\nindustry standard for a reason. None of\r\nthis should be read as don't use MCP. I\r\nlove MCP. I appreciate it. As I've said,\r\nI use it every day. But because it's\r\npopular and because people misunderstand\r\nhow LLMs work, I see these seven\r\nmisconceptions cropping up all the time\r\nand they absolutely doom integrations\r\nand they poison people's thinking about\r\nLLMs and MCPs. They think, \"Oh, well AI\r\nis not for me. AI is not going to be\r\nuseful. AI is not going to deliver ROI.\"\r\nWell, no. The problem is you asked MCP\r\nto do what it was never designed to do.\r\nMCP is is designed to be a tool calling\r\nutility for an LLM chat experience. That\r\nwas the original design. If you are\r\nputting it into a situation where it is\r\noutside that latency envelope, where\r\nyou're not really asking it to infer,\r\nwhere you're giving it dirty data, where\r\nyou're exposing it to customers in a way\r\nthat's insecure, you can't blame MCP for\r\nthe fact that it fails. That's just\r\nusing the wrong tool for the job. That's\r\nusing a hammer on your pipes, which I\r\nknow, you know, some plumbers will do,\r\nbut generally speaking is not\r\nrecommended. So, use your MCP correctly.\r\nUse it as an intelligence layer.\r\nSeparate it from your operations. Make\r\nsure that if you're using microservices\r\narchitectures, you don't treat MCPS like\r\na silver bullet. Thank you for listening\r\nto my soap box here. Model context\r\nprotocols are something I'm super\r\npassionate about. I want you to succeed\r\nwith them, but that requires most\r\norganizations unlearning one or more of\r\nthose seven issues. Best of luck with\r\nyour MCP.\r\n\r\n"}
